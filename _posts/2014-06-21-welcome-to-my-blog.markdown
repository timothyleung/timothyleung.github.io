Welcome to my tech blog. My name's Tim. I am an undergrad student in [University of Melbourne][unimelb] studying computer science and passionate about system security and operating system. This website is for developers who wish to better understand computer system and computer security. 

The goal of the blog is to provide tutorials that can make readers have better understanding about computer system. 

I encourage comments and willing to hear from you. I know I still have a lot of rooms for improvement, so don't hesitate to leave comments and send me emails (tleung@student.unimelb.edu.au)!

Have a nice day,
Tim
