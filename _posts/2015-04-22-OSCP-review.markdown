I got my OSCP finally after spending few months on it. I reckon this is not easy at all and most importantly you need to know how to learn by yourself. 

I do not have a sound background on penteration testing and most of the things are new to me. I was studying in university at the time I was doing this course. This course really take tonnes of focusing time. It will be really tough if you have a full time job or a full time student. Prepare to be no social life if you have a similar background as me.

The course covers a broad area about penetration testing. The materials itself (Videos and pdf file of 300 pages) will give you a concise idea on the topics. You will learn much more by goolging yourself while you are working on the lab machines. 

The topics that covered are 
<ul>
	<li> Bash scripting </li>
	<li> Essentials Tools such as nc, wireshark, tcpdump </li>
	<li> Information gathering, <code>enum4linux</code>, <code>nmap</code> etc.. </li>
	<li> Buffer Overflows </li>
	<li> Working with exploit </li>
	<li> File Transfer </li>
	<li> Privilege Escalation </li>
	<li> Client side attack (<code>XSS</code>, <code>email with attachments</code>, <code>Web browser exploits</code>)</li>
	<li> Web application attack (<code>SQL Injection</code>, <code>Password cracking</code>)</li>
	<li> Tunneling, Pivoting, Port Forwarding</li>
	<li>Metasploit Framework</li>
</ul>

I would say all of them are really interesting after taking the course. Before I took the course, I only have a brief idea about them. 

For people who would like to take this course:
<ul>
	<li>Make sure you have allocate enough time for this</li>
	<li>Self learning is IMPORTANT</li>
	<li>You do not need knowledge in debugger</li>
</ul>
