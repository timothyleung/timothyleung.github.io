The task can be found by searching UVA11902 on Google. It is about finding a dominator in a graph, the definition of dominator is - From node S to node Y, if you must pass through X to reach Y, then X is a dominator of Y. 

We can solve this problem using dfs. 
<ol>
	<li>Call dfs(0) to record all the vertices that are reeachable from starting node</li>
	<li>To check if vertex Y is dominated by vertex X, we can "turn off" all the outgoing edges from X and run dfs(0) again</li>
	<li> If it is reacheable, then X does not dominate Y, else X dominates Y</li>
	<li> Repeat this process for all V-1 vertices against Y </li>
</ol>

As the graph is small (V < 100) and the given time is 2 seconds, we can afford this algorithm. 
DFS runs in O(V+E), so the time complexity will be O(V^3). 

Just a reminder, there are three ways to represent a graph
<ul>
	<li> AdjMatrix 
		<ul><li>Good for dense graph </li></ul>
	</li>
	<li> AdjList 
		<ul><li> More space efficient, depends on graph density </li></ul> 
		</li>
	<li> Edge List 
		<ul><li>For MST algorithm, sort by edges</li></ul>
	</li>	
</ul>
